A Python development evironment eg: [LiClipse](https://www.liclipse.com/download.html)
[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/#files)

## Tests

## How To Use

To use the GUI, run main.py

First, uplink and downlink connections must be established. To do this, select 
ports you want to use for the uplink and downlink using the drop-down menus
labelled "Uplink COM" and "Downlink COM" and enter the uplink and downlink rates
in the text fields to the immediate right of the drop-down menus. Set the connection
then open it. If you want the downlink and uplink connections to be the same, 
enter the same infomration for both uplink and downlink. The connection must be 
closed before another can be established 

Use the buttons on the top left of the window to issue commands. Custom commands
and TLE information can be sent using the text field labelled "Input". TLE information 
must have '\r\n' separating the two lines e.g. "1 25544U 97067A   08264.51782528 -.00002182  00000-0 -11606-4 0  2927\r\n2 25544  51.6416 247.4627 0006703 130.5360 325.0288 15.72125391563537"
The bottom text field displays the programs output. The top right text field displays 
a table of packet contents. stdout can be directed to the GUI's console or Python's 
console using the buttons below the GUI's console.
